# ✅ Swagger Auto-Launch Fixed!

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

The Swagger UI was not opening automatically because `launchBrowser` was set to `false` in the launch settings.

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### File: `POS.API/Properties/launchSettings.json`

**Before:**
```json
{
  "launchBrowser": false,
  "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5216"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "launchBrowser": true,
  "launchUrl": "swagger",
  "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5216"
}
```

### What This Does:
✅ **`launchBrowser: true`** - Opens browser automatically  
✅ **`launchUrl: "swagger"`** - Opens directly to Swagger UI page  

---

## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Stop the Current API
If the API is running, stop it by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

### Step 2: Restart the API

**Option A - Using Batch File:**
```bash
cd PosBackend
START-API.bat
```

**Option B - Using Command Line:**
```bash
cd PosBackend/POS.API
dotnet run
```

### Step 3: Verify
✅ Your default browser should automatically open  
✅ You should see the Swagger UI at: http://localhost:5216/swagger

---

## 🌐 Expected Result

When you run `dotnet run`, you should see:

```
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
      Now listening on: http://localhost:5216
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
```

**And then:** Your browser automatically opens to http://localhost:5216/swagger 🚀

## 📊 Swagger UI Features

- **GET** `/api/auth/health` - Health check

### Try It Out:
1. Click on an endpoint to expand it
2. Click "Try it out"
3. Fill in the request body (for login):
   ```json
   {
     "email": "admin@cxp.com",
     "password": "Admin123!"
   }
   ```
4. Click "Execute"
5. See the response below!

## 🐛 If Browser Still Doesn't Open

### Possible Reasons:
1. **Default browser not set** - Set a default browser in Windows settings
2. **Running from VS Code** - Terminal might suppress browser launch
3. **Running as background process** - Remove `&` or background flags
4. **Security/Group Policy** - Check corporate restrictions

### Manual Workaround:
Simply open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5216/swagger
```
