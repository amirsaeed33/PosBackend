# üîß Fix Login Issue - Password Hash Problem

## Problem
The password hashes in the database were incorrect, causing login failures even with correct credentials.

## Solution
Updated `DatabaseSeeder.cs` with correctly generated BCrypt password hashes.

## Steps to Fix

### 1. Stop the Running API
The API is currently running in the background. Stop it by closing the terminal or pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running.

### 2. Reset the Database
Run the batch file to drop and recreate the database:
```bash
cd PosBackend
RESET-DATABASE.bat
```

### 3. Restart the API
```bash
cd POS.API
dotnet run
```

The API will automatically seed the database with correct password hashes on startup.

### 4. Test Login
Open your Angular app at `http://localhost:4200` and try logging in with:

**Admin:**
- Email: `admin@cxp.com`
- Password: `Admin123!`

**Shop:**
- Email: `downtown@mithai.com`
- Password: `shop123`

## What Was Fixed

‚úÖ Generated correct BCrypt hashes using BCrypt.Net (work factor 11)
‚úÖ Updated DatabaseSeeder with new hashes
‚úÖ Fixed login form email display (added @ symbols)
‚úÖ Created reset script for easy database refresh

## Verification

After restarting the API, you can test the endpoint directly:

```powershell
$body = @{ email = "admin@cxp.com"; password = "Admin123!" } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5216/api/auth/login" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body $body
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Login successful",
  "user": {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "CXP Admin",
    "email": "admin@cxp.com",
    "role": "Admin"
  },
  "token": "..."
}
```

## Files Modified

- `POS.Core/Data/DatabaseSeeder.cs` - Updated all password hashes
- `POS/src/app/login/login.component.html` - Fixed email display
- Created `HashGenerator` utility to generate correct hashes
- Created `RESET-DATABASE.bat` for easy database reset

## Important Note

‚ö†Ô∏è **Email addresses MUST include the @ symbol** - they are email addresses, not just usernames!

Correct: `admin@cxp.com`
Wrong: `admincxp.com`
